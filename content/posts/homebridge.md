## Homebridge in my Smarthome

I recently tried Homebridge, a self-hosted app that can act as a Bridge between devices that are not Apple Homekit ready and Apple Homekit.

So far I successfully tried it with different WIZ Lights, a Philipps Somneo Sleep & Wake-Up Light, a Dyson fan as well as some Govee sensors.
